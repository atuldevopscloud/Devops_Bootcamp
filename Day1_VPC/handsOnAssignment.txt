# AWS VPC Networking – Simple Hands-on Lab

## What this project covers

* Connecting to **public and private EC2 instances**
* Using **WSL (Ubuntu on Windows)** for SSH
* Understanding **VPC networking basics**
* Practicing **secure key management (.pem files)**

---

##  Overview

* **VPC** with CIDR block
* **Public Subnet**

  * EC2 with public IP
  * Internet Gateway attached
* **Private Subnet**

  * EC2 without public IP
  * Accessible only via public EC2 (jump server)
  ** Also covered Route tables,NAT Gateways,Elastic IP,IGW
---

## Used

* Windows laptop
* WSL (Ubuntu)
* AWS EC2
* SSH / SCP

---

## Key Steps Performed

### 1. Set up WSL on Windows

* Installed Ubuntu using WSL
* Accessed Windows files via `/mnt/c/`

### 2. Manage PEM Key Safely

* Copied `.pem` file from Windows to WSL
* Moved key to `~/.ssh/`
* Fixed permissions:

  * `chmod 400 Jan26.pem`

### 3. Connect to Public EC2

* Used SSH from WSL:

  * `ssh -i ~/.ssh/Jan26.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>`
* Verified successful login

### 4. Connect to Private EC2 (via Public EC2)

* Copied PEM key to public EC2 (jump server)
* Fixed permissions on EC2
* SSH from public EC2 to private EC2:

  * `ssh -i Jan26.pem ec2-user@<private-ip>`

---

## Common Errors & Fixes

* **Permission 0555 / bad permissions**

  * Fix: `chmod 400 Jan26.pem`

* **Identity file not accessible**

  * Fix: Use correct path to `.pem` file

* **Permission denied (publickey)**

  * Fix:

    * Correct username (`ec2-user`)
    * Correct key
    * Security group allows SSH

---

## What I Learned

* Difference between **public vs private subnets**
* How **jump servers (bastion hosts)** work
* Why SSH key permissions are critical
* How WSL simplifies AWS access from Windows

---

## Why this project matters

* Demonstrates real-world AWS networking
* Shows secure access to private resources
* Useful for **Cloud / DevOps / SRE interviews**
